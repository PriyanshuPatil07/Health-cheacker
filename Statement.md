Problem Statement

People often experience common symptoms such as mild fever, cough, headache, or tiredness and may want a simple way to check and understand their condition. However, they may not always know how to interpret these symptoms. The purpose of this project is to create a basic, console-based Python program that asks the user a few simple health-related questions and then provides a clear summary of their symptoms along with general, non-medical comfort tips such as resting, staying hydrated, or taking warm fluids.
This program is designed for educational use only, helping users become more aware of their symptoms while practicing basic Python programming concepts.

Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is to develop a simple, console-based Python program that helps users reflect

Target Users of the Project

The target users of this Symptom Checker program are:

General users who want to quickly check their basic symptoms.

Students learning Python and practicing simple input/output programs.

Beginners in programming who want to understand condition-based logic.

Teachers who need simple projects to demonstrate basic coding concepts.

Individuals wanting awareness of their symptoms in a simple, non-medical way.

High-Level Features


Interactive symptom input: The program collects basic health-related information such as temperature, cough, headache, and tiredness through simple user prompts.


Symptom evaluation: It interprets the user’s inputs to identify whether the symptoms indicate high temperature or general discomfort.


Summarized output: The system presents a clear and organized summary of all symptoms entered by the user.


General wellness tips: Based on the symptoms, it provides non-medical, general comfort suggestions such as rest and hydration.
